# LetItOut

## Idea
A "Social Network" where users can publish their stories, their outlets or whatever else, completely anonymously.

##Where am I?
I'm just a begginer and I don't know anithing about backend at the moment, so everything is made in pure js, html and css.
At this moment users messages are stored as a JSON file online.

## Wanna Help?
Yes please, there are so many things to do, and whoever would like to partecipate is wwelcome!

## ToDo
[ ] make the website responsive for smaller screen. At the moment it works only for laptop and other bigger screen.
[ ] backend to store safely all the messages
[ ] any good idea is welcome!

Thanks, Lorenzo

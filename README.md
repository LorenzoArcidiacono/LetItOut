# LetItOut

## Idea

A "Social Network" where users can share their stories, their outlets or whatever else, completely anonymously.

## Where am I?

I'm just a beginner and I don't know anything about backend at the moment, so everything is made in pure js, html and css.
At this moment users messages are stored as a JSON file online.

## Wanna Help?

Yes please, there are so many things to do, and whoever would like to partecipate is welcome!

## ToDo

- [ ] make the website responsive for smaller screen in both orientation. At the moment it works only for laptop and other bigger screen.
- [ ] backend to store safely all the messages
- [ ] any good idea is welcome!

Thanks, Lorenzo
